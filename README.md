CurriculumAgent
===============

CurriculumAgent is a Reinforcement Learning Agent designed to learn from and act within the  
[Grid2Op Environments](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Originated from the [NeurIPS 2020 Competition 
Agent by binbinchen](https://github.com/AsprinChina/L2RPN_NIPS_2020_a_PPO_Solution), this package contains a cleanup 
and improved version of the agent. Next to the general code cleanup, the package is updated for the newer Grid2Op 
version and future research results are planed to be published for this package.
